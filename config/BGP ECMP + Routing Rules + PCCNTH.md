# BGP ECMP + Routing Rules + PCCNTH (BGP Load Balancer) 2 ISP  80/20 %

## Firewall Mangle splits traffic 80/20 using NTH or PCC.


`````
/ip/firewall/mangle
# Mark Connection: 80% to ISP1
add chain=prerouting connection-mark=no-mark nth=5,1 action=mark-connection new-connection-mark=to-ISP1 passthrough=yes

# Mark Connection: 20% to ISP2
add chain=prerouting connection-mark=no-mark nth=5,2 action=mark-connection new-connection-mark=to-ISP2 passthrough=yes

# Mark Routing
add chain=prerouting connection-mark=to-ISP1 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=to-ISP1 passthrough=yes
add chain=prerouting connection-mark=to-ISP2 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=to-ISP2 passthrough=yes
``````


## Add Routing to Mark

``````
/ip/route
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ISP1_GATEWAY routing-mark=to-ISP1
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ISP2_GATEWAY routing-mark=to-ISP2
``````

## Result:

First 5 connections: 4 to ISP1, 1 to ISP2 â†’ 80/20

Do at session level (connection-level load balancing)


## ðŸ“Œ Note:

This method is Per-Connection Load Balance, not per-packet.

Be careful with some protocols that use many same sessions (e.g. video call, VPN, banking) â†’ may drop if switch path.

Can be used with Netwatch or BFD to check ISP failover.
